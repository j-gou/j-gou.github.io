### Welcome to Jiangtao Gou's Homepage
I am currently an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Fox Chase Cancer Center, Temple University Health System. Before joining Fox Chase Cancer Center, I was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics and Statistics at CUNY Hunter College between 2015-18, and was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences at Northwestern University between 2014-15. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Statistics at Northwestern University in 2014, focusing on multiple testing procedures for clinical trials.

My research mainly concerns development of complex statistical methods for health science and biomedical related problems. 
I have specific expertise in experimental design, clinical trial, data mining and quantitative research methods.
